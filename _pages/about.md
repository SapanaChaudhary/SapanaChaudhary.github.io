I'm a third year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Texas A&M University, TX, USA. I am being advised by [Dr. Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). I study reinforcement learning from an optimization perspective. 

<!--- In the long run, I want to focus on using principles from the human cognition and psychology to build better reinforcement learning agents.--->    

Previously, I was a research fellow in the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. I was advised by [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html).

I have completed MS (Research) in Computational Science from IIT Madras, India. My advisors during MS were [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). My MS thesis is titled 'On Learning Smooth Policies in Imitation Learning'.
