I'm a reinforcement learning researcher. Currently, I am primarily working on Inverse Reinforcement Learning. In the long run, I want to focus on using principles from the human cognition and psychology to build better reinforcement learning agents.    

I'm associated with [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Saarbrücken, Germany. I am being advised by [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html).

Previosly, I had completed MS (Research) in Computational Science from IIT Madras, India. I was advised by [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). My MS thesis is titled 'On Learning Smooth Policies in Imitation Learning'.
