Hello! I’m Sapana, an Applied Scientist at Amazon, focused on reinforcement learning (RL) post-training. 

In December 2025, we launched Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) as a service—details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-serverless-customization-in-amazon-sagemaker-ai-accelerates-model-fine-tuning/). This release brings powerful, serverless model customization to developers, and I’m proud to have worked with an incredible team to enable customization for open-source models in Amazon SageMaker AI. You can now fine-tune leading models—including **Qwen, Meta’s Llama, DeepSeek, and OpenAI’s gpt-oss**—using advanced techniques such as: **RLAIF** (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback), **RLVR** (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), **SFT** (Supervised Fine-Tuning), and **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization). These capabilities make it easier to build higher-quality, more controllable models tailored to your use case—without the overhead of managing infrastructure.

Earlier, I received my doctorate from Texas A&M University (TAMU) working with [Dr. Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). At TAMU, I focussed on making AI systems safe by including various notions of safety in online learning, RL, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Previously, I was a research fellow at MPI-SWS, Germany with [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). I also did a MS (Research) at IIT Madras with [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). 

<!---  I have worked on multiple algorithmic paradigms in RL ranging from generative adversarial imitation learning to meta-RL. More recently, I have pivoted towards fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This pivot reflects my growing interest in the intersection of natural language processing and reinforcement learning. I have also built abstractive and extractive Q&A systems using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs while doing an applied science internship at Amazon.

In the long run, I want to focus on using principles from the human cognition and psychology to build better reinforcement learning agents.   

Previously, I was a research fellow in the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Saarbrücken, Germany. I was advised by [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html).

I have completed MS (Research) in Computational Science from IIT Madras, India. My advisors during MS were [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). My MS thesis is titled 'On Learning Smooth Policies in Imitation Learning'. -->

Aside from work, I like to hike, cook, paint, and [photograph](https://www.instagram.com/a.thing.of.art/).
