Hello! I am Sapana, a final year PhD student at Texas A&M University. I am being advised by [Dr. Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). I am passionate about using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve challenging real world problems. I have worked on multiple algorithmic paradigms in RL ranging from generative adversarial imitation learning to meta-RL. More recently, I have pivoted towards fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This pivot reflects my growing interest in the intersection of natural language processing and reinforcement learning. I have also built abstractive and extractive Q&A systems using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs while doing an applied science internship at Amazon.

<!--- In the long run, I want to focus on using principles from the human cognition and psychology to build better reinforcement learning agents.   

Previously, I was a research fellow in the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany. I was advised by [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html).

I have completed MS (Research) in Computational Science from IIT Madras, India. My advisors during MS were [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). My MS thesis is titled 'On Learning Smooth Policies in Imitation Learning'. -->
